# Problem Solving Steps

## Understand the Problem

- Restate the problem in your own words<br>
- What are the inputs?<br>
- What are the outputs?<br>
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough info?)<br>
- How to label important data?<br>

## Explore Concrete Examples

- Start with simple examples with an input and an output<br>
- Progress to more complex examples<br>
- Explore examples with empty inputs<br>
- Explore examples with invalid inputs<br>

## Break It Down

- Write out the steps needed to take<br>

## Solve/Simplify

- If possible, Solve the problem<br>
- If NOT possible, solve a simpler problem:<br>
- Find the core difficulty<br>

## Look Back and Refactor

- Can you check the result?<br>
- Can you derive the result differently?<br>
- Can you understand it at a glance?<br>
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?<br>
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?<br>
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?<br>
- How have other people solved this problem?
